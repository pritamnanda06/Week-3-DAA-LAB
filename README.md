For Q1

Overview & Justification

Binary Search: Divides the search space into $2$ nearly equal halves at each step and requires $1$ comparison per iteration to determine the branch. Its worst-case time complexity is proportional to $\log_2 n$.

Ternary Search: Divides the search space into $3$ parts using two midpoints, requiring $2$ comparisons per iteration. While its number of steps is $\log_3 n$, the total number of comparisons is roughly $2 \log_3 n \approx 1.26 \log_2 n$.

Validation: Because ternary search performs more comparisons per level ($2$ comparisons instead of $1$), its total operation count is higher than binary search, making binary search more efficient for 1D array searching.


For Q2

Algorithm Overview & Complexity

Divide and Conquer Strategy: The array of coins is divided into two equal halves at each recursive step, simulating a balance weighing scale.

Time Complexity: By utilizing prefix sums for $O(1)$ range weight calculations, each recursive step runs in constant time, yielding an optimal time complexity of $O(\log_2 n + c)$ (where $\log_2 n$ represents the number of scale weighings and $c$ handles the constant-time overhead).
